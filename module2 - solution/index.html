  		<p class="content-name name1">Chicken</p>
  		<p class="content">Chicken fried rice is the comfort dish of Chinese food. It's been around for a very long time and is also common in East, Southeast, and South Asian cuisines. The dish started as way to use leftover fried rice that has dried out some and may not be great on its own, but is still perfectly edible. The addition of oil and soy sauce and veggies and meat spruce up the rice for a delicious meal. A traditional Chinese fried rice would be made in a wok over high heat, but we've made ours in a cast iron skillet.</p>

   		<p class="content-name name2">Beef</p>
   		<p class="content">The word beef is from the Latin bōs,[10] in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words have the same Indo-European root *gʷou-).[11] After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served. Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used for the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox) (Modern French bœuf) by the French nobles.</p>

  		<p class="content-name name3">Sushi</p>
  		<p class="content">Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish. Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish.</p>
